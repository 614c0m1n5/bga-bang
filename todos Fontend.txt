- implement Notification for BangNotificationManager::updateOptions
- implement Notification for BangNotificationManager::moveCard (this is only for Dynamite)
- playable cards are no longer contained directly in the state args but in the index cards.(js is already adjusted to that)
	In addition there is the index character.
	if this is not null, it can be either OPTION_NONE(=0) or OPTION_CARDS(=3). in both cases we need an action button for using character ability.
	in the second case the player will need to select 2 Hand Cards to discard.
	The action to be called is named useAbility and should be used like discardExcess
- implement selectCard state. arguments: 
	- args.amountToPick (always) the number of cards the active player needs to pick
	- args.amount (only when cards aren't visible to all) the amount of cards to choose from, in case you want to show a face-down selection for the others. if not, tell me.
	- args.cards (only if visible to all) the cards to choose from, formatted as usual
	- args._private.cards (only for active player and only if selection is not visible for all) the same
- finish state drawCard. This state is only for the draw phase of Jesse Jones and Pedro Ramirez. Check the onEnteringStateDrawCard, that i already created to avoid errors. 
	What's still needed here is to make the deck/discard pile selectable. Atm those work only with action buttons
- adjust react State: args.amount now contains the amount of hand cards needed to react. Usually 1 except when Slab The Killer played Bang!. Keep in mind, that Barrel can still be played alone(i think)
- Black Jack has to show the second card he draws. For now i just send a message to all, that tells them both the name and the "copy" (written like 'Hearts J').
	Do you want to show that card somehow? if so, tell me what notification(s) and arguments you want here.
