- adjust react State: args.amount now contains the amount of hand cards needed to react. Usually 1 except when Slab The Killer played Bang!. Keep in mind, that Barrel can still be played alone(i think)
- bug: when lucky duke is in jail and it's his turn, the selection appears but the cards are disabled.
- Handle playerEliminated notification. arg.player and args.role are provided.
- show roles of eliminated players. setup args now contain the array 'eliminated' of the eliminated players with their id and role.
- implement gameEnd state
- bug: dynamite diappears after moving(until reload)
- equipping 4 cards looks weird
