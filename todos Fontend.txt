- implement Notification for BangNotificationManager::updateOptions
- implement Notification for BangNotificationManager::moveCard
- playable cards are no longer contained directly in the state args but in the index cards.(js is already adjusted to that)
	In addition there is the index character.
	if this is not null, it can be either OPTION_NONE(=0) or OPTION_CARDS(=3)
	in the second case the player will need to select 2 Hand Cards to discard.
	The action to be called is named useAbility and should be used like discardExcess
